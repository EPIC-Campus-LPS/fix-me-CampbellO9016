# fix_me Activity

## Objective
- Practice professionalism in computer science by fixing a low quality codebase.

## Getting Started

You are a senior programmer who has been sent this project for review. You are responsible for making sure this code 
reflects good coding practices and adheres to [these style guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
This could include renaming variables and classes, creating helper methods, writing comments and tests, etc.

Here is a short description of the required features.
- Student Data Management: Create a class to define a student that stores a name, an ID number, and a list of integer test scores.
- Roster Storage: Use an ArrayList to store and manage multiple student objects.
- Data Initialization: Populate the system with sample data (instantiate specific students and add their scores to the list).
- Average Calculation: Implement a method to calculate the arithmetic mean of a student's scores.
- Letter Grade Conversion: Determine the letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) for each student based on their calculated average.
- Full Roster Report: Iterate through the roster to print a formatted line for every student showing their ID, Name, Average, and Letter Grade.
- Top Performer Analysis: Identify and print the name and average of the student with the highest score in the class.
- Failing Student Filter: Identify and print a list of names for all students whose average score is below 70.
